# My Digital Class Room



## Current Situation 
- COVID-19: Creating a paradigm shift in India’s Education System .The pandemic has forced universities/schools to bring their courses online.
- This is just one step along the road to a new educational paradigm, however. We can expect a new model to emerge once COVID-19 has passed
- The pandemic that has shuttered economies around the world has also battered education systems in developing and developed countries.
- Some 1.5 billion students — close to 90% of all primary, secondary and tertiary learners in the world — are no longer able to physically go to school.
- The impact has been dramatic and transformative as educators scramble to put in place workable short-term solutions for remote teaching and learning, particularly in emerging markets, where students and schools face additional challenges related to financing and available infrastructure.

##  Research and Analysis
- We conducted the survey with various schools to understand the day to day challenges that they are facing while adapting the new norm of E-learning and conducting the online classes. 
- We have identified some most common problem areas for the roles like School Authority (Principal/Vice Principal), Class Teacher, Subject Teacher and Students and have worked upon them to propose a solution in the application
