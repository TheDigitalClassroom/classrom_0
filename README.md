## Today’s challenges 
- COVID-19 has created a paradigm shift in India’s Education System which has forced universities/schools to bring their courses online.
- Most of the primary, secondary and tertiary learners in the India — are no longer able to physically go to school.
- The impact has been dramatic and transformative as educators scramble to put in place workable solutions for remote teaching and learning. This has been challenging considering that students and schools now face additional difficulties related to financing and availability of digital resources.
